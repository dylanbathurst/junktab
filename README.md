# Dev Helper
An electron based menu bar app for mac.

Dev helper is a very simple a text editor that you can show/hide with convenient keyboard shortcuts `Command + Shift + X` to open and `esc` to close. This is very useful to keep you in flow while coding. 

## Usage
While coding in your editor of choice, if you would like to remove a line of code (ex. `console.log('foo')`) temporarily but not delete it completely you would highlight the line, "Command + c" to copy, `Command + Shift + X` top open dev helper, `Command + v` to paste, `esc` to close dev helper and return focus to your cursor in your text editor.
Before making dev helper I would use an extra tab to solve this but would frequently lose the tab and have to search for it in a forrest of tabs. Dev helper simply makes that process much faster so you stay in flow.
